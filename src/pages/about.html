  This site provides online voting functionality for meetings. In order to access the site you will need to use 
  the anonymous access token that you were given when you registered into the meeting by the meeting secretary.

  DemocrApp is provided by <a href="https://democrapp.co.uk">democrapp.co.uk</a>. We use <a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a> 
  to log any errors and make sure they're dealt with.

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>What if my device doesn't work properly?</strong>
    Take your token to one of the e-voting kiosks and place your votes there.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>What if my device stops working?</strong>
    You can re-authenticate on any compatible device, or move to using one of the aforementioned e-voting kiosks.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Am I really anonymous?</strong>
    The system only knows you have a valid token, and is never given any more information about you. We don't use any 
    device fingerprinting, and the app is reset completely after the site logs out.
  </li>
</ul>

  Everything gone wrong? Please contact your meeting secretary who will be able to help. Also please try reloading this page 
  in an Incognito/InPrivate browsing session if you are experiencing issues.

<p>
  DemocrApp relies on some fairly modern web standards, so older devices or web browsers might struggle. It's also worth checking
  you're all up to date, we find this site works most reliably in the latest version of Google Chrome.
